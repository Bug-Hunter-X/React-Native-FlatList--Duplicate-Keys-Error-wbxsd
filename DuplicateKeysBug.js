This error occurs when using the FlatList component in React Native and trying to render items that have a key prop that is not unique.  React Native requires unique keys for efficient rendering and to avoid unexpected behavior.  Duplicate keys lead to inconsistencies in rendering, data updates, and potential crashes.  This is often missed because the duplication might not be immediately obvious in the data source.
